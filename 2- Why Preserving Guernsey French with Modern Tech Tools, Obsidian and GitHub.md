## Introduction

Preserving the Guernsey French language is a community effort that requires the involvement of linguists, researchers, community members, and enthusiasts. By using tools like Obsidian and GitHub, we can leverage the power of Creative Commons and crowdsourcing to gather, organize, and share resources. This collaborative approach ensures that the language is preserved for future generations and remains accessible to all.

## Why Use Obsidian and GitHub?

Using Obsidian and GitHub together provides a powerful and flexible solution for preserving the Guernsey French language. These tools enable you to create a structured digital archive, collaborate with others, and ensure that the language is accessible for future generations. By involving the community and leveraging Creative Commons and crowdsourcing, we can gather a rich collection of resources and keep the Guernsey French language alive.
### Obsidian

- **Markdown-Based**: Obsidian uses Markdown, a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. This makes it perfect for creating and editing text files.
- **Linking and Organization**: Obsidian allows you to create links between notes, making it easy to organize and navigate through related content. This is particularly useful for creating a structured digital archive.
- **Local Storage**: All notes are stored locally on your computer, ensuring that you have full control over your data.
- **Plugins and Customization**: Obsidian supports a wide range of plugins that can enhance your note-taking experience, including the Obsidian Git plugin for version control.

### GitHub

- **Version Control**: GitHub provides powerful version control, allowing you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others.
- **Collaboration**: GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with others, whether they are linguists, researchers, or community members. You can share your repository and work together on preserving the language.
- **Accessibility**: By hosting your repository on GitHub, you make it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This ensures that the digital archive can be accessed and contributed to by a global audience.

## How These Tools Can Help

### Digital Preservation

- **Text and Audio**: Use Obsidian to create and organize text files, and GitHub to store and version control these files. This ensures that all digital records are preserved and can be easily accessed and updated.
- **Collaboration**: Invite linguists, researchers, and community members to contribute to the repository. This collaborative effort can help gather a comprehensive collection of resources.

### Language Learning and Research

- **Educational Resources**: Create educational materials and resources in Obsidian, and share them via GitHub. This can support language learning and promote cultural understanding.
- **Research**: Researchers can use the digital archive to study the language, its usage, and its evolution. GitHub’s version control ensures that all changes are tracked and documented.

### Community Involvement and Crowdsourcing

- **Creative Commons**: Encourage contributors to use Creative Commons licenses for their work. This ensures that the resources can be freely used, shared, and built upon by others.
- **Crowdsourcing**: Leverage the power of crowdsourcing to gather a wide range of materials. Community members can contribute texts, audio recordings, and other resources, enriching the digital archive.
