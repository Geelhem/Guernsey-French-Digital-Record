**Digital Archive for Guernsey French**

This is a secondary school student-led program by the Ladies College Guernsey in support of the Guernsey Language Commission.

Welcome to the official repository for the Digital Archive of Guernsey French – an initiative dedicated to the preservation and revitalisation of Guernesiais or Guernsey French, a language on the brink of extinction. Our mission is to create a comprehensive digital record of all available resources, including texts, audio recordings, and cultural artefacts, to ensure the survival and accessibility of this invaluable linguistic heritage.

This repository serves as a collaborative platform for linguists, researchers, community members, and enthusiasts to contribute, share, and utilise resources. By digitising and curating these materials, we aim to support language learning, promote cultural understanding, and facilitate academic studies. Join us in our endeavour to keep the Guernesiais or Guernsey French language alive for future generations.

**Objectives:**

- Digitally preserve a critically endangered language, which currently lacks a standardised spelling.
- Safeguard the language by recording native speakers and creating a digital library of audio recordings.
- Create a digital record of existing written work by creating a digital library of bilingual texts.

**Requirements of this repository:**

- Data extracted from images and PDFs should be converted to text files and organized, indicating whether the content is in English (`eng`) or Guernsey French (`gf`) https://github.com/Geelhem/OCR-import-tool-for-Digital-Record. 
- Digitization must comply with copyright laws or have the express permission of authors.

Our students have set up a contact email (gf@ladiescollege.gg) and a form (submission form https://forms.office.com/e/qtPAzwwP5z ) for anyone who would like to submit audio recordings of people speaking Guernsey French. We encourage anyone from the local Developers’ Community or anyone with coding skills to get in touch or contribute to our GitHub project pages.
