In the eighteenth century, Trinity House, the society which maintains the
lighthouses around the coast of England, took responsibility for the Casquets and
three men were put in charge as keepers; two at a time whilst the third went to
Aldemey for a month. En 1855 the towers were made higher, but in 1877 there was
only one light, in the St. Pierre tower, and the two others were shortened again.

For eighteen years, during the nineteenth century, a family named Houguez lived
there without ever leaving the rock, Each member of the family took his, or her, turn
to look after the light; father, mother and the six children. A boat came from Aldemey
each month and there was a little garden made with soil brought from the island
where they could grow some vegetables and a few flowers. That little garden is still
there, sheltered by the three towers.

During the Second World War the Germans used the Casquets as a signal station for
their ships. In 1942 some English commandos attacked the lighthouse and took
prisoner the seven Germans who were there. They left a message; “If you put more
men on this rock, they will also be taken prisoner.” Apparently they attacked the
Casquets a number of times, and one of the men who was important at this time was
Captain “Bonnie” Newton as he was known in Guemsey after the war. He knew the
seas around the islands very well and also the Casquets reef, its tides and dangers.
After the war he used to take visitors to Herm in his boat the Martha Gunn.

Since that time, there have been other wrecks on, or near, the Casquets, too many to
mention here. It continues to be a very dangerous place regardless of the weather or
tidal conditions, even with the navigation aids that we have now.
