At the enquiry in December 1807, at Portsmouth, the captain, the officers and crew
were exonerated from all blame except for those who had escaped up the cliffs when
they landed.

Forty years later, a diver discovered fifteen cannons and a lot of cannon-balls
amongst the rocks and sand which had almost covered the Boreas, but everything was
left as it was. More than fifty years after the wreck, Les Hanois lighthouse was built
and the light was lit in November 1862. Since that time, other cannons and guns have
been found and these relics are in Fort Grey Museum at Rocquaine.
