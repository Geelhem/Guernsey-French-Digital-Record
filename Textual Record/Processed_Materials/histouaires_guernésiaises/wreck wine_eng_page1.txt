Of course, many people drank far too much and there were many drunkards around.
There were even some who fought each other, and for a while there was trouble in
some areas, Others who had more sense took their barrels home and hid them where
they could and they had some wine for years. Though, it must be said that the wine
was not of the best quality.

With time, as the ship broke up, other barrels floated ashore. These were smaller
than the others and very strong. When they were tapped, it wasn’t wine that was in
these little barrels but a strong spirit which really pleased the “boys.” There were a lot
of people who had headaches for a time after the disaster.

There was a lot of talk about the wreck of the Briseis, and as I have mentioned
already, it is still remembered to this day.
