### When beetles invaded Guernsey!

English Version : 
The evening of July 13th, 1967, was peaceful there was hardly any wind. The
boats anchored near the jetty at Saint’s in St. Martin’s didn’t move on the sea. A yacht
was anchored among the little boats of the fishermen and the two people on board
were fast asleep.

At that time, the ship President Garcia was passing close to the coast of Guernsey
en route from Sierra Leone in Africa to Rotterdam in Holland with a cargo of copra.
This copra is what is around coconuts before they are separated and the nuts are eaten
whilst the copra is used to make matting and other things. The ship was travelling at
twelve knots and there was no fog.

At twenty minutes before midnight this large ship found herself amongst the little
boats anchored at Saint’s and struck bow first into the cliffs which are two hundred
and fifty feet high there. Two young people who were at the little harbour had a great
shock when they saw the ship and they could see that she was not going to stop. They
said later that they felt the shock when she struck and the noise was terrible. She
passed between the yacht and some boats, but she sank some others.

Another man who saw the accident said later that he thought that the ship was going
to towards the Pea Stacks but she turned towards Moulin Huet. She turned again and
ended up by crashing into the cliffs. She had not reduced speed at all and when she
struck, the noise was terrible. He fetched a friend and the two men went to the harbour
to salvage engines and what was left of the boats.

The captain, when was interviewed by the authorities, said that no-one would be
allowed ashore during the night. When he was shown the charts of where the ship
was, he could not believe it. He believed that he was near Ushant —an island in
Brittany, one hundred and twenty miles away! It was high tide and it was decided to
try and remove the ship from her position against the cliffs. The engines were put in
reverse, but the bow would not move. It was very damaged and water was entering
the ship.

Two tugs arrived from Holland and tried for an hour and a half to tow her from
there, but without success. It was hot during those days, and the crew opened the
hatches to allow air into the hold. Two or three days later, hundreds of beetles flew
from inside the hold towards St. Martin’s. People had to close their windows -the
insects were everywhere. All over the island people found them and they were a
nuisance.

There were plans to unload part of the cargo to lighten the ship which would help,
perhaps, the tugs to pull her from where she was. There was also a risk of pollution
for oil was leaking into the sea. Three hundred tonnes of copra were taken on’ board
two ships from Holland and that helped the tugs. A week after the President Garcia
found herself at Saint’s, the tugs Willem Barrenz and Utrecht managed to pull her
from there. They began at five in the afternoon and for more than an hour the two
large powerful tugs did their best. At six o’clock the ship began to move and
suddenly, at eighteen minutes past six, she had slipped into deep water. All those who
had been watching from the cliffs and from small boats cheered and clapped their
hands. The ship sounded her siren as she was towed towards Town. There only
remained some oil on the water to show that a ship had spent a week there.

Guernesiais Version:

Quand des étcherbots envahirent Guernési!

La seraie du treize juillet 1967 était trantchille - i n’y avait pas quasi d’vent. Les
batchaux ancrais prés d’la cauchie 4 Saints 4 St. Martin n’bougeaient pas sus la mair.
Aén yacht était ancrai parmi les p’tits batchaux des paissouniers et tes daeux

A chu temps-la, l’baté President Garcia passait prés d’la caoute dé Guernési_ en

dé copra. Chu copra est chu qu’est autour des coconaettes d’vant qu’i saont separais et
les nouais saont mangies tandique lé copra est fait servi pour faire des nattes et ditai
tché. Lé baté allait 4 douze naeuds et i n’y avait pas d’breune.

A vingt minutes d’vant migniet chu grand baté s’trouvit parmi les p’tits batchiaux

Daeux jonnes gens qu’étaient au p’tit havre aeurent aén grand choque quand

En aoute haomme qui vit l’accident, dit pus tard qu’i pensait qu’I’baté s’en ailait

Lé captoine, quand i fut entervaeu par les autoritais, dit qu’autcheun n’s’rait pas

The Casquets.

At any time, the reef of the Casquets is dangerous. No matter if boat is large or
small, if the sea is rough or smooth elsewhere, there are always swells, bad tides or
currents around these rocks and it is soon in trouble. The reef is seven miles to the
west of Alderney and extends nearly a mile from east to west with larger reefs to the
north and south. Apart from these large rocks which always show above the water —
there are some which are fifty to eighty feet high there are other reefs which are
covered by only three or four feet of water at high tide. The large rocks are called
Lighthouse Rock, La Callotte, Little Casquet, L’Auquiére and Noire Roque. At first,
when it was reported that the Stelfa had struck the Casquets on monday, March 30"
1899, the authorities could not say for sure which rock it was. Later it became clear
that the first rock it scraped past was L’ Auquiére which is forty-four feet above high
tide and is just to the west of the rock with the lighthouse. At high spring tide, the sea
rises and falls as much as thirty feet at the Casquets. When the Captain tried to avoid
hitting L’ Auquiére, he steered to the right but straight in front of him he saw the Noire
Roque. When he changed course again, the ship was taken over the reef that was
under the water between the two rocks. He was going so fast that he did not have the
chance to stop and the ship was wrecked.

Besides the dangers of the sea, the tides and the currents around the Casquets, there
was always the danger of fog. The lighthouse had a foghorn, but it was not always
possible to hear it from all directions. That day, in 1899, the fog was so thick that a
man was sent to the bow of the ship to watch and listen for the foghorn. If the ship
had passed only a hundred yards to the west of the Noire Roque, it would have arrived
as usual in Guernsey.

For centuries, shipwrecks have been reported on the Casquets reef. In 1120, it is
said, the only son of Henry | of England was drowned there during a storm,with one
of his sisters and all the crew of the ship La Blanche Nef or the White Ship in English.
If you talk about it to people from Barfleur in the Cotentin near Cherbourg, they will
tell you that Prince William was drowned just outside the little harbour there. This
name is well known in the history of England because Henry did not have another son
to succeed him as heir to the crown. The result was nineteen years of civil war
between Mathilda, (a daughter of William the Conqueror and sister of Henry 1* ) and
one of her cousins, Stephen of Boulogne. The death of the young prince changed the
history of England.

In 1701 the ship Michael was en route to Lisbon in Portugal when it struck one of
the rocks at the Casquets, but a few days later all the crew was saved by another ship.
The men had found limpets, some fish and enough fresh water to survive.

Eight years later, the Governor of Alderney asked Queen Anne of England if he
could build a tower on the Casquets and put a light there to warn mariners of the
danger around there. The rocks were rented to a man called Le Patourel who had to
look after a coal fire to warn mariners of the danger. The coal was brought to the
Casquets, probably from Alderney, when the weather was fine. After sixty years, in
1785, the Governor at that time, Peter Le Mesurier, became the tenant. In 1785 , three
towers were built —Donjon, St. Pierre and St. Thomas. At first the light was a coal
fire, and then it was an oil lamp. In 1790 it was a lamp able to revolve.

In 1774 also, the frigate Victory sank at the Casquets with eleven hundred men on
board. The next warship of that name was Admiral Nelson’s ship which was at the
battle of Trafalgar on October 21° 1805.

In the eighteenth century, Trinity House, the society which maintains the
lighthouses around the coast of England, took responsibility for the Casquets and
three men were put in charge as keepers; two at a time whilst the third went to
Aldemey for a month. En 1855 the towers were made higher, but in 1877 there was
only one light, in the St. Pierre tower, and the two others were shortened again.

For eighteen years, during the nineteenth century, a family named Houguez lived
there without ever leaving the rock, Each member of the family took his, or her, turn
to look after the light; father, mother and the six children. A boat came from Aldemey
each month and there was a little garden made with soil brought from the island
where they could grow some vegetables and a few flowers. That little garden is still
there, sheltered by the three towers.

During the Second World War the Germans used the Casquets as a signal station for
their ships. In 1942 some English commandos attacked the lighthouse and took
prisoner the seven Germans who were there. They left a message; “If you put more
men on this rock, they will also be taken prisoner.” Apparently they attacked the
Casquets a number of times, and one of the men who was important at this time was
Captain “Bonnie” Newton as he was known in Guemsey after the war. He knew the
seas around the islands very well and also the Casquets reef, its tides and dangers.
After the war he used to take visitors to Herm in his boat the Martha Gunn.

Since that time, there have been other wrecks on, or near, the Casquets, too many to
mention here. It continues to be a very dangerous place regardless of the weather or
tidal conditions, even with the navigation aids that we have now.

Les Casquets

A autcheun temps, lé banc des Casquets est dang’raeux. I n’y a pas d’souogn si aén
baté est grand ou p’tit, si la mair est rude ou pliatte ailleurs, i y a terjous des sovels et
des mauvaises maraies et couorants autour dé ches rotchers et il est bian vite en brou..
Lé bane est & sept milles au vouest d’Aurgny et s’étend quasi enne mille dé |’est au
vouest dauve des pus grands bancs au nord et au sud. Apart des grands rotchers qui sé
Mmouitrent terjous en d’sus d’iaou - i y en a qu’aont dé chinquante a quater-vingts pids
d’hauteur — i y a d’aoutes bancs qu’aont riocque treis ou quate pids d’iaou qui les
couvrent a plloinne mair. Les grand’rocques saont noummaies Lighthouse Rock, La
Colotte, Little Casquet, L’Auquiére et la Noire Roque. Au prumier, quand i fut
rapportal qué lé Stella avait tappai sus Les Casquets jeudi, lé 30 dé mars 1899, les
autoritais n’pouvaient pas dire pour saeure sus quai rocque qué ch’tait. Pus tard, i
d’vint cllaire qué lé prumier rotcher qu’i racllit fut L’Auquiére qu’est 4 tchérante-
quate pids en d’sus plloinne maraie et qu’est justement au vouest du rotchet dauve la
tour. Au grand filo, 1a mair maonte et d’vale jusqu’A trente pids és Casquets. Quand lé
captoine éprouvit a évitair dé tappair sus L’Auquiére, i navigit 4 dret mais draette en
d’vant d’li i vit la Noire Roque. Quand i d’virit d’bord derchier, lé baté fut print
pardessus 1é banc sous iaou ente les daeux rotchers. Il allait si vit qu’i n’aeut pas la
chance d’arretair et lé baté d’vint naufragi.

Décaute les dangiers d’la mair, les maraies et les couorants autour des casquets, i y
avait terjous lé dangier dé breune. La tour avait enne come a breune, mais i n’était pas
terjous possible dé la ouir dé toutes directiaons. Chu jour-la en 1899, la breune était
épasse et enn’haume fut enviyai au naiz du baté pour guettair et écoutair pour la corne
a breune. Si I’baté avait passai riocque chent verges au vouest d’la Noire Roque, il
érait arrivai comme dé couteume 4 Guernési.

Pour des siéclles, des naufrages aont étai rapportais sus I’banc des Casquets. En
1120, il est dit, lé seul fils du roué Henri ler d’Anglleterre fut niaf la dans enne
taempéte dauve ieunne dé ses soeurs et tout l’étchipe du baté La Blanche Nef ou en
Angllais The White Ship. Si vous parlaiz és gens dé Barflleur au Cotentin prés dé
Cherbourg, i vous diraont qué lé prince Willaum fut niai juste en tuours du p’tit havre

n’avait pas enn’aoute fils pour lé siére comme héritier d’la couraonne. Lé résultat fut
dix-neuf onnaies dé guére civile ente Mathilde, enne fille dé Guillaume le Conquérant
et la soeur d’Henri ler, et iun dé ses cousins Stephen dé Boulogne. La mort du jonne
prince changit I’histouaire d’ Anglleterre.

En 1701, lé baté Michael était en route pour Lisbon au Portugal quand i tappit sur
iun des rotchers des Casquets, mais tchiques jours pus tard tout l’étchipe fut sauvai
par enn’aoute baté.

Huit ans pus tard, 1é Gouvernaeux d’Aurgny d’mandit 4 la Roine Anne
d’Anglleterre s’i pouvait batir enne tour sus les Casquets et y maette enne vaeux pour
guernir les mariniers du dangier par-la. Les rotchers furent louais 4 enn’haomme
app’lai Le Patourel qu’avait 4 souognier aén faeu d’tcherbaon pour avertir les
mariniers du dangier. Lé tcherbaon fut apportai és Casquets, probabllement d’Aurgny,
quand i faisait bael. Oprés sesante ans, en 1785, treis tours furent baties - Donjon,
Saint Pierre et Saint Thomas. Au prumier, la vaeux était aén faeu d’tcherbaon, et pis
ch’tait enne lampe a huile. En 1790, ch’tait enne lampe qui pouvait tournair.

En 1774 étout, la frigade Victory faongit sus les Casquets dauve aonze chents
haommes a bord. La perchoine frigade dauve chu naom fut l’baté du Amiral Nelson
qu’était a la bataille dé Trafalgar lé 21 Octobre,1805.

1877 i y avait riocque enne vaeux, dans la tour dé St. Pierre, et les daeux aoutes furent
raccouchies derchier.

Pour dix-huit ans, durant lé dix-neuviéme siéclle, enne fomille app’late Houguez y

Durant ta Dacuxiéme Guérre Mondiale, les Allemands firent servir Les Casquets
comme enne station pour signalair 4 laeux batchiaux. En 1942 des commandos
Angllais attatchirent les Casquets et prinrent prisounier les sept Allemands qu’étaient

### Orion - another kind of wreck

English Version: 
My husband walked our dog three times a day; usually the last walk was between
eight and half past nine in the evening. On the evening of February 1" 1978, he went
out a little later than usual because it had rained and been so windy that he would
have been completely soaked. He waited until the rain stopped even though the wind
was as strong as it had been at nine o’clock. At last, at about eleven o’clock, he put on
his oil-skins and went off with the dog saying, ”I won’t be long.”

At midnight I thought, “Where is he? What’s happened?” A few minutes later he
came back, very wet but rather worried.

“There’s something happening between Vazon and Grandes Rocques. I could hear a
helicopter and boat engines. There are lights everywhere on the sea and I think that
the life-boat is there as well. Perhaps it’s a wreck or a ship in danger ~ I couldn’t
make out what it was, but it was enormous. Well, we’ll see tomorrow, I suppose.”

Next morning, we listened to the news on the radio, and yes, there had been a wreck
at Grandes Rocques. But it was not a large ship as we expected, it was an oil platform
(an oil-rig as we say in English.)

At twenty-five past eight the previous evening, the police in Guernsey had received
a message from the harbour station that an enormous platform, the Orion, had broken
free from the tag which was towing it from Rotterdam in Holland to Brazil with a
crew of thirty-three men on board. It was the property of an American company; it
weighed nineteen thousand tons and its supports were two hundred feet high. It was
mounted on a kind of boat — a barge in English — for the voyage to Brazil and it was
insured for nearly seventeen million pounds, the greater part of it in London.

All the emergency services were called out and the life-boat left the harbour in
Town. The tug Seefalke which had towed the Orion tried to reattach the large cable to
the platform but without success. It was damaged itself when it touched bottom twice
during its efforts, and its crew had to pump water out of the boat to keep it afloat.

The life-boat took two men off the Orion but the crew hesitated to leave it. By this
time, it was drifting towards Grandes Rocques and at twenty-five past eleven it was
aground on the rocks one hundred and fifty yards from the beach. It looked like a
building with all its lights on. By midnight, two helicopters from Culdrose in
Cormwall had saved all the crew except six men who were still on board. There were
gusts of wind of between sixty and seventy knots and when the tide moved the rig, the
helicopters had to stop because it was too dangerous to continue. Two men were
saved by a special buoy (breeches buoy),and the four who remained the next day.

A salvage company from Holland got the contract to salvage the rig and sent two
tugs to Guernsey. Another tug was necessary and after a few days, on February 27" ,
they succeeded in pulling it from its place on the rocks and towed it to Cherbourg.

Guernsey had never seen anything like that before. Large crowds of people went on
to the rocks at Grandes Rocques each day to see that enormous platform and they
were amazed by its long supports (legs). They could see them from nearly all over the
island and everyone was talking about it.

The pilots of the two helicopters and the coxswain of the life-boat received awards
for their part in the rescue of the thirty-six men. No-one lost his life that night, a night
full of excitement,

### The Prosperity

English Version :

On January 16" 1974, the harbourmaster at St. Peter Port received a message at the
White Rock station that a ship was in danger close to Guernsey. What followed was
one of the worst disasters around the coast of the island during the 1970's. At ten
minutes to four on that afternoon it was blowing a gale. The message gave the
position of the ship — she was between twenty and twenty-five miles to the west of the
Hanois (lighthouse). The lifeboat Sir William Arnold left the harbour at that time, but
at eleven o’clock the coxswain in charge, John Petit, sent a message which said that
the storm was so strong — force 11- that it was impossible to see anything because of
the excessive spray and the rollers which were twenty-five feet high.

The next day, the lifeboat tried again to find the ship in danger. It left the harbour at
six-thirty in the morning and it went to search along the south coast until it was sent
towards La Conchée, a rock near Perelle. There the crew saw the ship Prosperity
aground on the reef of rocks. She had been lost with all on board in full view of land
and the enormous ship Elwood Mead which had struck Les Grunes outside Vazon on
Christmas day.

The Sir William Arnold found seven bodies in the sea about a mile from Pleinmont
and transferred another four from a German steamer which had found them. Sixteen
bodies were found, one was the young wife of the captain, but Captain Geoggiou
Kastellorizias and the boatswain Uzoglan Ibrahim were never found. Later the
authorities found out that the ship had been en route from Finland to the
Mediterranean. She carried a cargo of wood. Because of the bad weather, the ship
broke in two and her cargo of wood was thrown into the water. A lot of this wood
floated along the coast and was collected from the beaches and from the bottom of the
cliffs by the Guernsey people. The police guarded some great piles of wood on the
beaches but it had been announced that people could collect the wood until midday.
There were hundreds who went with their lorries and even wheelbarrows to gather
what they could. The beaches and rocks were covered with wood. Later, the
authorities said that the announcement was not correct and all the wood should be
handed to the police. The greater part of it was returned.

Th police sent the bodies of five men to Greece to be buried in their country; the
other members of the crew were buried at the Foulon (Cemetery), those who were
Muslim were buried according to the last rites of their religion.

A fund was begun to build a monument to the memory of those who had been
drowned during that terrible night, and it was built at L’Erée in sight of La Conchée.
At low tide it is possible to see a part of her engine — that is all that is left of the
Prosperity.

It is a tragedy that, if the sailors had stayed on board, perhaps they might have been
able to climb on to the reef of La Conchée at tow water,

### The Boreas disaster

English Version :

On the night of 28" November 1807, the warship Boreas found herself on the
Hanois reef during a terrible storm and sank at half past five in the morning the next
day. There were more than one hundred and ninety-five officers and sailors on board.
The ship left the harbour of St. Peter Port during the aftemoon of the 28" when she
received a message that a small boat was in difficulty near the west coast with two
men on board. Even though it was very bad weather, the Boreas found the boat and
began to tow it towards the harbour. It began to get dark and the sailors were ordered
to watch out for any danger. The wind came from the north-west and the wooden
warship began to roll with each roller. Suddenly a sailor shouted, “There are rocks
straight ahead!”

Too late, the captain did not have time to avoid hitting the rocks. He gave orders to

hoist more sail and the ship advanced about two hundred yards and for a moment the
men on board believed that the warship had got away. But no! A moment later she
had struck harder on another rock and this time she was holed and the sea came in
fast. The two men in the little boat which the Boreas had taken in tow decided that it
was time to save themselves and they cut the rope and went off towards the coast.
They reached the beach but, it is said, they did not try to alert the authorities of the
disaster.
The cannons were fired to try and let the inhabitants along Rocquaine and L’Erée
know that a ship was in great danger at Les Hanois, but they thought that it was a
French ship and they were not going to help it. When the captain realised that there
would be no help. He ordered that each man be given a measure of spirits and the
small boats put into the water. One would go and seek help and the other two would
take the sick and wounded ashore. They would return to the Boreas to fetch other
sailors, The seamen who reached land at Pleinmont escaped up the cliffs but, it is said,
did not help their comrades.

There is a great deal of information about the wreck in the newspapers of that time,
much more than can be included here, but it seems that the captain told his seamen
still aboard the Boreas to find shelter in the stern of the ship. They stayed there all the
rest of the night, but early in the morning they heard a terrible noise and the ship
slipped downthe rocks and under the sea.

The crew was thrown into the sea, but there were some who climbed up the rocks or

on to rafts which they had made from driftwood during the night. The captain
managed to climb on to one of these rafts, but he died after a short time and the sea
took his body. When it was light, the men on the rocks were saved by fishermen from
Rocquaine who, at last, decided to go to sea to see what was happening.
During all this time, the soldiers at the fort at Pezeries did not hear or see what was
happening at Les Hanois. They were too busy with the sick and the women who were
at the fort that night. In a letter from Vice-Admiral Sir James Saumarez, (who was in
charge of the navy in Guernsey), to the Admiralty in London, he said that he had sent
two ships, the Brillant and the Jamaica to Les Hanois to aid the Boreas but they could
do nothing for the wreck. They saved thirty men from the Hanois reef and other men
from the small boats were saved as well. He mentioned, also, the courage and good
behaviour of Captain Robert Scott, his officers and crew during this terrible night.
With great regret he had to report that the captain and more than one hundred and
twenty of the crew had been lost.

### Two cargoes of coal

English version: 

On the 23" August 1906, a ship which was carrying a cargo of 1,300 tons of coal hit
the reef of rocks to the north of Vazon known as the Grunes. The Swansea was on
route from Swansea in Wales to St. Malo. It had a crew of fourteen men and a boy
who were under the command of Captain Hall of Jersey. When the ship left Swansea
it wasn’t long before it was entirely enveloped in a fog so thick that they saw nothing
before the ship hit the Grunes.

A little later it slid down the rock and into the sea, but there was so much damage to
the hull of the ship that the captain ordered the crew to get into the small life-boats.
The tug Assistance arrived and towed the steamer to Vazon where it ended up on the
sandy beach. A large part of the cargo of coal was thrown out of the ship on to the
sand to lighten it and temporary repairs were done. There were a lot of people who
went to Vazon each day to see how the work was progressing. The Swansea was
salvaged soon after — but I have never found out what happened to the coal!

I can remember the wreck of the Fermain on the 29" December 1952. She belonged
to the company O. Dorey & Sons of Guernsey and she was a ship of one thousand and
eighty tons. That day, she was approaching the harbour at Saint Sampson’s and had
reduced speed to enter the harbour. As this was happening, there was a delay and she
was carried by the tide and wind which was very strong. The captain couldn’t have
enough steam from his engines in time and the ship drifted on to the Black Rock
outside the harbour. The cargo was essential to the island, so a causeway was built
between the Fermain and the road which goes round the coast there. An opening was
cut in the side of the hull and the coal was loaded into wagons which took it to the
coal merchant. Later the ship was sold to the company J. Upham & Sons of Guemsey
and it was broken up and sold as scrap iron. Today we can see what remains of the
bridge which leads to the Black Rock which was well named when the coal was being
taken out of the ship!

### The wreck of the Courier.

English Version: 

The weather was beautiful that day. There was no wind and the sea was calm and
smooth like glass. It was April 30" 1906. In the morning, when the ship Courier II
left the harbour of St. Peter Port, there were about eighteen passengers on board and
nine crew members with the captain. The passengers were looking forward to seeing
their relations and friends in Sark, or to spending a good day there.

At five o’clock the boat was ready to return to Guernsey with twenty-seven
passengers on board. The Courier left the little harbour at Creux as the tide was rising
and the captain took his marks towards the Great Russel just as he had done dozens of
times before. It was still fine and the visibility was good, but the sea had become a
little rough.

The boat was to the south of Jethou, near some rocks called Les Ferriéres when —
according to what a passenger said later at the enquiry — she hit a rock. Everyone on
board heard a dreadful noise, as if the propeller had been ripped from the ship. The
captain ordered the lifeboats to be put into the water and then he steered the boat on to
Les Ferriéres. He thought that he could save the passengers and perhaps the ship.

The steamer sank very quickly and those who were in the small boats were thrown
into the sea. The crew feared that the engine was going to blow up because so much
steam was coming out of the ship. There were twelve or thirteen people in a small
boat, but there were even more in the water with life-belts. Even though it all
happened so quickly, there was no panic. For about half an hour the boats picked up
the people in the water and took them to the reef of rocks, even though the sea was
rolling a lot now.

The boat Alert arrived and put its life-boats in the water, and soon the pilot boat
Vixen followed her and picked up the people from the rocks. The two boats stayed
there until seven in the evening to look for survivors and then they returned to St.
Peter Port.

By the time that those who had been saved landed, there was a great crowd of
people on the White Rock and all along the jetties. The disaster was seen from the
town and there were those who said that there were ten thousand people at the harbour
that evening. By this time, the Courier had sunk completely. The Afert had fourteen
survivors on board and many of them were injured. A Mr. Thorburn was picked up
from the sea, and even though he still had on his life-belt, a doctor pronounced him
dead. The boat Vixen arrived with the people who had been on the rocks - one of
whom was the captain. He had stayed on board the Courier but he had been thrown
into the water and had been saved.

When all the passengers were counted, the authorities found out that four men and
three women had been drowned and three of the crew also, One of the passengers was
the Seigneur of Sark —Mr. W.F. Collings —but the report in the Press did not say
whether he was one of the drowned.

The next day, it was discovered that the Courier had sunk in sixty feet of water. All
the post was lost and nothing was saved from the ship. Later, a diver went out to the
wreck to examine it and it was decided to raise the Courier from the sea-bed. The
captain was partner-owner of the ship but she was not insured. On July 30" some tugs
and the Alert went to raise her and took her towards the harbour in town. However at
ebb tide the wreck touched bottom and it was left there until August 4" when it was
raised again on the rising tide and this time it was towed by the Alert to the
Cambridge Berth. The cable snapped but the wreck was almost dry. When she was
examined, the authorities found a split from the stern to the middle of the ship on the 
starboard side under the water-line. On the other side, to port, there were holes and it
was possible to see right through the ship. A search of the boat found the body of a
man but he was unrecognisable. Some jewellery found with him identified him —-he
was a Mr. Walter Long from Bradford in England. His wife had been saved.

On the same day, August 4”, a body was found on a beach near Cherbourg. It was a
man and he was about sixty years old. At the Court of Enquiry which followed the
disaster, Captain Whales was found guilty of negligence. He should have taken more
care and the ship was too near the rock La Gouliniére.

On October 5" 1906, the Courier was towed to Southampton where she was built
and the company Day &Summers did the repairs on the ship which they had
constructed. By the month of December that same year, the Courier was in Guernsey
‘once more to continue her service as she had done for years. During the First World
War she was painted grey, but during the Second World War, the ship found herself
in Scottand, on British Admiralty service on the Clyde. The little steamer came back
to the island in July 1947 and there was a great crowd of people at the harbour to
shout, “Hurray!” and blowing of fog-horns when she entered the pier-heads.
However, unfortunately before the end of the year, the owners sold her because she
was too old and cost too much to maintain. She was taken to Holland where she was
broken up for scrap. That is how the story of the Courier I] ended, but for a long time
the people of Guernsey remembered her. Some verses about the wreck were even
written by a Mr. Amy.

The ship which sank near Jethou was the second Courier. The first boat went
between Guernsey, Alderney and Cherbourg from 1876 to1913 with passengers and
cargo. The same company which were the proprietors of the Courier I, Alderney
Steam Packet Co., bought the Courier 7 in 1883. She was a little bigger and did the
same work on the same route,

### A shipwreck -and a jot of wine

English Version : 

There still some peopte who can remember the strange wreck of a ship on the rocks
at Albecq on the first of October, 1937. The result of this wreck was a lot of drinking
and a lot of iaughter.

The Briseis, a French ship of three thousand tons, was carrying a cargo of wine,
spirits and other things. She had been built in Germany in 1917 and was en route from
Oran to Rouen in Normandy. A fisherman who saw the ship too close to the rocks
near there, said later that he was sure that she would not be able to avoid hitting the
teef known as Les Grunes.

When the ship struck, the captain stopped the engines and then started them again to
take her off the rocks. He wanted to reach as far as Vazon which is a sandy beach and
he hoped to save the vessel. Perhaps the steering gear was damaged because he found
himself amongst the rocks at the end of the point at Houmet. It was a good thing that
the ship sank before hitting a rock and no-one lost his life.

Soon, a great crowd of people arrived to find out what had happened. There were
hundreds of them along the coast, attracted by the non-stop noise of the ship’s siren.
By this time, all could see that the bow was well down in the water and that the stern
was beginning to rise into the air. Suddenly the bow slid under water and at the same
time the boilers burst and sent water and steam right up into the air. The ship sank
completely — there were only the tops of its chimney and masts which showed above
the sea.

There was some bother around there later! As soon as the ship began to break up,
the barrels of wine and spirits floated along the beach and on to the sand. There were
hundreds of them and those who were watching rushed down the beach to “save” the
barrels. They thought that Christmas was early that year! When the captain of the
Briseis, Léon Le Hellidu, realised that the ship was sinking, he had ordered the crew
to abandon ship and they all climbed into the small boats. A little later the fishermen
arrived in their boats and towed the survivors to Grand Havre. It appears that the
vessel sank in about seventy feet of water and that there was only six feet of water
over the Grunes when it struck.

When the captain was taken to the scene to assess the situation, he was very
distressed because he could not understand how the wreck had happened — he had a
great deal of experience of navigating around Guernsey, especially along the west
coast. The Briseis had been holed under the bow and it was possible that there was
damage to the keel as well.

As soon as possible the authorities published an advertisement about the ships
cargo. Everything found on the beach or floating in the sea had to be declared to the
States’ Supervisor. There were almost three hundred barrels of Algerian wine on
board and only a few were declared. Some were found near St. Martin’s point; others
near Sark, to the north of the island and beyond.

All this time, other barrels were tapped on the beach amongst the rocks and people
drank the wine there or filled bottles, cans - anything in which could they could carry
the wine home, even (it was said later) chamber-pots!

Of course, many people drank far too much and there were many drunkards around.
There were even some who fought each other, and for a while there was trouble in
some areas, Others who had more sense took their barrels home and hid them where
they could and they had some wine for years. Though, it must be said that the wine
was not of the best quality.

With time, as the ship broke up, other barrels floated ashore. These were smaller
than the others and very strong. When they were tapped, it wasn’t wine that was in
these little barrels but a strong spirit which really pleased the “boys.” There were a lot
of people who had headaches for a time after the disaster.

There was a lot of talk about the wreck of the Briseis, and as I have mentioned
already, it is still remembered to this day.
