Soon after they had passed the ﬁl::ges lighthouse on the Isle of Wight, the Stella began her voyage of sixty-four iles towards the Casquets and the islands.

There? was great competition betvyeen the compognies to encourage the people to use their service. In 1890 the service from Weymouth was carrying more passengers than. that of Southampton, so the LSWR company ordered three new steamers to be built —the Frederica, the Lydia and the Stella. The Frederica made the fastest passage at the beginning, but in the Guernsey Star of 13\" November 1890 there was a report that the Stella had made the voyage from Jersey to Guernsey in about one hour twenty minutes. Five days later, another report said that the same ship had passed the Needles lighthouse on the Isle of Wight four hours and ten minutes after it had left the harbour in Guernsey. The GWR company replied to this news with a report that its ship the Ibex had made the same voyage in an extraordinary time in 1891 — three hours thirty minutes! FIn thc?
