The horizon was no longer as clear and soonrf Mo roll towards the ship.

E e bridge the visibility was so bad, the ship continued its journey at more than e?éhtven though something which was confirmed at the enquiry after the disaster by twoeen ot who had spoken with the Chief Engineer at that time and who had seen thepasseln SET8 counter of the engines. The fog whistle sounded from time to time but the r::vo ution began to worryfblelcause the ship was still going so fast. , e A member of the crew was sent to the bow of the shi i the Casquets.

Another thing, he would 1Se some time. Just before four o’clock, everyone on board should have’ heard the fzse horn at the Casquets but they didn’t hear anything. At four o’clock they heard the fog: horn which sounded in their ears right above the ship, and at the same time tﬁe member of the crew who had been at the bow of the Stella came running toward; the bridge shouting, ”Stop! Stop!” The men on the bridge saw an immense rock which had appeared at the moment the fog had cleared, about forty-five yards in front of the ship. At once, the captain ordered the engineer to put the engines in reverse, but it was too late. The Stella scraped along the rock and then drove to the right when another rock appeared and the keel hit three times with a noise, described at the enquiry by a passenger, as if a train travelling very fast was trying to stop. The ship was pushed further on to a reef of rocks with so much force that its engines were torn from their place. It passed over these rocks and found itself in deeper water, but the water was already coming through a gash cut through its length halfway up the hull. The Second Officer George Reynolds, the only officer on the bridge who survived, said later that there had been a feeling of a “strange calm.” The captain ordered the small life-boats to be put into the water and said calmly, ”\"Women and children first and then the men.” There was some panic amongst the passengers. There were some who had been asleep in their cabins or who had been lying in the benches in the saloon and they had been thrown on to the floor. They didn’t have time to get dressed but some women didn’t forget their jewellery boxes. There were plenty of life-belts made of cork in the old-fashioned way. (700 for the passengers and 43 for the crew.) The men watched as the little boats with their wives and children left the Stella but there were some women who didn’t know what to do, and they cried out and wept on the deck. They didn’t know that the Stella had only another se\\.'en.mmutes above water. The sea was filling up the ship rapidly and it was already sinking by the stern in 160 to 170 feet of water. The Chief Engineer managfed to shut down t]?e ,cngme§ and to allow the steam to escape and to close two~vs(ater-t1ght doors. He reahs;d that it wouldn’t make any difference and'he went to the bridge to report to tl}e captain. Things would have been worse if the little boats had not been put into the water so quickly. Four boats were carrying almost all the women and clpldren — but not all. There were two stewardesses in the crew — for one, Ada Preston, it was her first","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
