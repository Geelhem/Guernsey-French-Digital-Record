L’Erée know that a ship was in great danger at Les Hanois, but they thought that it was a French ship and they were not going to help it. %en the captain realised that there would be no help. He ordered that each man be given a measure of spirits and the small boats put into the water. One would go and seek help and the other two would take the sick and wounded ashore. They vs{ould return to the Boreas to fetch other sailors. The seamen who reached land at Pleinmont escaped up the cliffs but, it is said, did not help their comrades. There is a great deal of information about the wreck in the newspapers of that time, much more than can be included here, but it seems that the captain told his seamen still aboard the Boreas to find shelter in the stern of the ship. They stayed there all the rest of the night, but early in the morning they heard a terrible noise and the ship slipped downthe rocks and under the sea. The crew was thrown into the sea, but there were some who climbed up the rocks or on to rafts which they had made from driftwood during the night. The captain managed to climb on to one of these rafts, but he died after a short time and the sea took his body. When it was light, the men on the rocks were saved by fishermen from Rocquaine who, at last, decided to g0 to sea to see what was happening, During all this time, the soldiers at the fort at Pezeries did not hear or see what was happening at Les Hanois. They were too busy with the sick and the women who were at the fort that night. In a letter from Vice-Admiral Sir James Saumarez, (who was in charge of the navy in Guernsey), to the Admiralty in London, he said that he had sent two ships, the Brillant and the Jamaica to Les Hanois to aid the Boreas but they could do nothing for the wreck. They saved thirty men from the Hanois reef and other men from the small boats were saved as well. He mentioned, also, the courage and good behaviour of Captain Robert Scott, his officers and crew during this terrible night. With great regret he had to report that the captain and more than one hundred and twenty of the crew had been lost.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
