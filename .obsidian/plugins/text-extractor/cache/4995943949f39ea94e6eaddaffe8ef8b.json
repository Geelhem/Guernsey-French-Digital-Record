This, hopefully, will . help the regdel' who 11.133.7 not be too familiar with our language to learn some vocabulary and to become interested 1n it. As was explained in the previous book, Guernsey-French —or Guernésiais, developed from Norman-French which in its turn originated in Latin. It differs from that still spoken in the Cotentin in Normandy, Jersey and Sark, but is sufficiently similar to allow speakers from these areas to converse with one another. It was not, of course, a written language, but recently, during the last eighty years or so, native speakers have written various pieces —stories, plays . and poetry, which will help to preserve what we have left. Georges Métivier, who was born in | Guernsey, wrote a great deal of poetry during the latter part of the nineteenth century and was possibly the first to do so. Denys Corbet, who lived in the Forest parish also wrote poetry in & Guemnsey-French, French and English. This year, 2009, is the centenary of his death. E I must point out to non-native speakers that it is not always possible to translate directly from one language to the other. Also there are some sounds in the spoken language that do not exist in either standard French or English. Where the reader comes across a tréma, eg; &€, that vowel is pronounced as in French. The Guernsey-French vocabulary is fairly limited in some areas —it has not developed as, for example, French and other languages have done. It is mainly the vocabulary used in the home, on the farm and to do with fishing and so on. In other words it had to do with island life, and any new words brought in, mainly from England when the E tourist industry began during the nineteenth century and when greater contact was made with English speakers, the vocabulary began to include more and more English words interspersed with those available in the local language. The reader will come across English words which § have been changed slightly to make them sound Guernésiais but nevertheless it is sad fact % that our language just does not the modern words that are sometimes needed. Often a phrase E has to be used when just one English word will suffice. | | Spellings also differ. 1 have tried to be consistent in the way that I spell certain words. 1 | know that there will be those who will not agree with me about some spellings, but as has been pointed out many times, Guernsey-French was not a written language andiwe cach havzto d(; E g:ledb oL Wé can to make our written words understandable. 1 have dehberat:rlli :Lsem a}/;fit ; ings as in French in order to help those who are able to read that language E il 3","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
